# Converter
## What is it?
This is a conversion system created for PKO FinAt during UniStartApp project, organised by Innovation and Technology Transfer Management Centre (CZIiT) at Warsaw University of Technology.
## What does it do?
It allows simple creation of "blocks" of a data converter (read all elements, store single element, transform single element, write all elements) and their parametrisation (order in which they're used, settings of a given block).
